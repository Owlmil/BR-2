# ðŸŒ± Bridging Roots - Starter Repo

This starter repo provides a minimal scaffold for a 2D game hackathon project using:

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MySQL (sample SQL provided)

Run the frontend and backend locally. This repo is intentionally minimal so teams can focus on game logic.

See `frontend/README.md` and `backend/README.md` for quick start instructions.
